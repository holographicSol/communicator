# communicator
communicator intends to provide communication between two or more communicator applications running over loopback, local network and world wide web (www requires port forwarding from router to local ip address of host running the communicator). 

-- project in early development --> zero security (no SSL, no keys, nothing! :) You have been warned.

-- provides communicator to communicator communication without a honey pot server in between like social media platforms.
